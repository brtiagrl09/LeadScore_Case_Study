Goals of the Case Study
Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.


Steps Followed: 
  Data handling: Loading data, understanding data, cleaning data, removing unwanted column and handling missing value
  EDA: Univariate and bivariate analysis on Numerical and Categorical Data,  segementing data, handling outlier and correlation anaalysis
  Preparing Data for Modeling: Creating dummy varriable, removing extra field and Spliting Data
  Bulidng Model: Using Logictic regression, scaling, Feature Selection using RFE and removal field based on pvalue and then VIF
  Prediction: Prediction on train Data
  Model Evaluation
  ROC Curve
	
  Prediction: Prediction on test Data
	
  Precision and Recall
